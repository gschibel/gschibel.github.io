<ul> 
    <li> Lord, I want to thank you for our time together. Let this time together serve as a reminder that whether we are similar or very different. "We are called to love one another, just as you loved us." (John 13:34) May we continue to "Be kind and compassionate to one another forgiving each other, just as you forgave us."(Ephesian 4:32) In Jesus' name I pray, Amen!  </li>
    <li>I must spread the good news! God wants you well! </li>
    
    </ul>
