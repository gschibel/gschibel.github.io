<ul> 
    <li> Lord, I want to thank you for our time together. Let this time together serve as a reminder that whether we are similar or very different. "We are called to love one another, just as you loved us." (John 13:34) May we continue to "Be kind and compassionate to one another forgiving each other, just as you forgave us."(Ephesian 4:32) In Jesus' name I pray, Amen!  </li>
    <li>I must spread the good news! God wants you well! </li>
    <li>Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God: defend me from them that rise up against me. Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from bloody men. the mighty are gathered against me awake to help me, and behold. (Psalm 59)</li>
